### 1. What’s the difference between let and var?
- Both let and var are used for variable and method declarations in JavaScript. So there isn’t much of a difference between these two besides that while var keyword is scoped by function, the let keyword is scoped by a block.

### 2. Explain Hoisting in javascript. 
- Hoisting in javascript is the default process behavior of moving declaration of all the variables and functions on top of the scope where scope can be either local or global.
